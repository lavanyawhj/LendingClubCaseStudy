## General Information
- Provide general information about your project here.

  Like most other lending companies, lending loans to 'risky' applicants is the largest source of financial loss (called credit loss). The credit loss is the amount of money lost by the lender when the borrower refuses to pay or runs away with the money owed. In other words, borrowers who default cause the largest amount of loss to the lenders. In this case, the customers labelled as 'charged-off' are the 'defaulters'.

  

- What is the background of your project?

  The company wants to understand the driving factors behind loan default, i.e. the variables which are strong indicators of default. The company can utilize this knowledge for its portfolio and risk assessment.

  

- What is the business problem that your project is trying to solve?
